# Assignment1 - Research Track 1

The assignment involves spawning two turtles and, using two nodes written in C++, controlling the turtles with commands while ensuring they do not collide with each other and stopping the moving turtle if its position is too close to the boundaries.

## Overview
This project involves the development of two c++ nodes:
1. **node 1** called **Ui.cpp**: this node spawn a new turtle in the environment and give a table of command to control the 2 turtles.
2. **node 2** called **Distance.cpp**: this node checks the relative distance between turtle1 and turtle2, stops the moving turtle if the two turtles are “too close” and stops the moving turtle if the position is too close to the boundaries.
